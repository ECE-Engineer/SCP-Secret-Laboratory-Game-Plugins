# INDIVIDUAL PLUGIN ENTRIES
### SCP-999-X
##### Name: SCP999x
##### Description: SCP-999-X is a status effect that removes all negative status effects. It also has a healing effect on the effected player and nearby same-class players.

A random human player gets the ability at the start of the round. The player gets a HUD message of "you have been chosen!". Then all passive actions of the SCP are active till the end of the round or until the player dies. Currently one player gets the ability per round.

Updates on the plugin include:
- The player getting the benefits of the SCP-207 without the negative side effects
- The player getting their life saved upon a death situation (only a one time use) w/ a slight buff afterwards to escape

### Concluding Notes
As with many plugins that are mixed together from different developers and from which are all being used concurrently.
Please be aware of the likelihood that special edge cases may occur causing instability in your server instance.

### About my developer background with SCP Secret Laboratory:
I was for a short duration of time a voluntary plugin developer for "Pixel's SCP Community" where my SCP-999-X plugin had been active for a short duration of time.
Though I am the author of the original plugin and ideas behind the SCP-999-X plugin hosted on that server. I want to acknowledge "Tom aka. DGvagabond" for giving me tips when I was starting out familiarizing myself with the "Exiled" API for SCP SL game plugins. As of now, I have decided to go public with my contributions, since I am no longer a "voluntary" developer for those server's.
